	<p>The trek along the Singalila Ridge to Sandakphu and Phalut is one of the most popular ones in the Eastern Himalayas due to the grand vistas of the Kangchenjunga range and the Everest range which can be seen from the ridge, and also for the seasonal wildflower blooms and birding. Treks begin at Manebhanjan which is 28 km (1 hour approx. by road) from Darjeeling.
</p>	
<p>The trekking routes inside the Singalila National Park have four legs or stages.
</p>
<p>

  <u> <b> Manebhanjan to Meghma (2600 m)</b></u>: This is a 4-hour trek through the lower forest. The route goes via Chitre which has a Hotel (Eagle's Nest). If time and circumstances permit, trekkers can walk to Chitre instead of staying in Mane Bhanjang. This will allow them some leeway the next day. The place is isolated and much cleaner. However, guides and porters are mandatory for the trek and have to be booked in Manebhanjan.
</p><p>There is another shorter route via Dhotre which can be reached by hired vehicle from Siliguri. The trekking route takes one directly to Tonglu or Tumling (5 km). Staying facilities in Dhotre is very basic.
</p>
<p>
   <u> <b>Gairibans to Sandakphu (3636 m)</b></u>: This is a steep 4 hour climb. Roughly halfway up the climb is the village of Kala Pokhri (3186 m). The trekkers hut in Gairibans is clean and a good place to stay though a bit removed from the trek path.
</p><p><u><b>Meghma to Gairibans (2621 m)</b></u>: There are two alternative trekking routes. Both go via Tonglu (3070 m) and Tumling (2900 m). The boundary of the national park passes though Tumling where a checkpost is located. From Tumling, a shorter trail cuts through Nepal and Jaubari (2750 m).
