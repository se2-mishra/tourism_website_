<p>Once a princely State, Cooch Behar is known for its fine climate, natural freshness, and beauty. During the 11th and 12th Century AD, the Pala-Senas ruled Cooch Behar. The sculptures and coins of the Sultanate and the Mughal Periods, and the temples and mosques of the medieval and late medieval periods reveal that the ancient kingdom of Kamrup played a role in the development of the present Cooch Behar. The main attraction in Cooch Behar is the palace of the Koch king Maharaja Nripendra Narayan. Designed to resemble the classical European style of the Italian Renaissance, this magnificent palace was built by the Maharaja in 1887.

Cooch Behar is also famous for large water bodies. Among them the Rasik Bill is famous for a huge population of migratory birds that assemble here every year. The Forest Department has built accommodation at this site to meet the demands of a growing number of tourists interested in ornithology.

Bordering the Jalpaiguri district is the Chilapata Forest Range which is also an interesting trail for nature lovers.

Cooch Behar is also a land of temples. The most notable among these is the Madan Mohan Bari. The Madan Mohan temple, in the heart of the town of Cooch Behar, was built by Maharaja Nripendra Narayan during the period 1885-1889.
