<p>Several types of migratory birds arrive here each year from South Asian countries and coastal regions. They start arriving from June. The migratory species includes open-bill storks, egrets, night herons and cormorants.The resident birds are kites, flycatchers, owls, kingfishers, woodpeckers, drongoes, etc.

According to a 2002 census, 77,012 birds visited the sanctuary that year. In 2003, the figure was even higher at 81,384. In 2008 (according to a census), 91,540 birds visited. An average of 70,000 to 80,000 birds visit the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Here is a description from a visitor: “On our way out from Kolkata to Raiganj, we were about to cross the bridge over the Kulik river on National Highway 34 when we saw hundreds of storks circling a patch of forest across the river. Intuitively, I knew we had arrived... Once up there (tourist lodge observatory)... we saw that all the 30-odd trees in the lodge compound were occupied by hundreds of open-billed storks... During our half-hour in the observatory, we saw flocks flying overhead carrying twigs to build their nests. Those that already had nests were busy sitting on eggs or tending to hatchlings. It was equally fascinating watching some taking time off from family chores to preen themselves and smooth ruffled feathers.”

<br/>
<p>Global population of the Asian openbill is estimated to be 130,000 by Wetland International, and around half of them live in Asia. The species is known to breed in a colony, called heronry, but there are very few heronries in India, particularly those that are well protected against human greed. Ornithologically, Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary is a very important heronry. As per the breeding population data of Asian openbills, the sanctuary reveals that it regularly supports 32 - 40 percent of the existing population of Asian openbills of South Asia.
